A powerful minigame-world management and improvement plugin for Spigot Minecraft servers

This plugin can help you control and improve your minigames world. This plugin has per-area inventories to help prevent items being carried across different games. Another feature set is an entire lobby, from gadgets, music, double jumping, and a game selector item complete with customizable GUIs. This plugin will turn a disorganized games world into a very clean and organized world once set up.

This project never had a public final release, so there are no documentation or wikis available.
