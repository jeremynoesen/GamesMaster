# GamesMaster

## About

GamesMaster is a Spigot plugin that can help you control and improve your minigames world. This plugin has per-area
inventories to help prevent items being carried across different games. This plugin also has lobby management features
that add things such as gadgets, music, double jumping, and a game selector, all with customizable GUIs. This plugin
will turn a disorganized games world into a very clean and organized one once set up.

## Purpose

This plugin was created as a means of organizing a games world in a server I worked for. Previously, we had the issue of
players breaking games because they would teleport away, or lose their inventories for the same reason. We needed a way
to prevent this problem, as well as simplify the games world overall. In the end, This helped make the world feel much
more organized, secure, and more fun overall.

## Notice

This project was abandoned. The original version was made specific to the server it was originally written for, so there
are no releases available. This project will most likely not be completed.
